			<li>Aim of the app</li>
			
			<p>Movement therapy is a key building block in treatment and rehabilitation Of patients with cardiovascular disease. Decisive is an individual to the Patient-matched therapy with medically prescribed heart rate limits to a To achieve the goal of therapy effectively without overstating the patient. The "Guideline Physical activity for the secondary prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases" distinguishes six categories of intensity from "very light" (level 1) to "maximum" (level 6).</p>
			
			<p>Real-time monitoring and documentation of heart rate during cardiosports With the introduction of various non-invasive measuring principles and systems for the Patients easy and cheap possible. The manufacturers of the sensors usually offer Visualizations for the gym, which are often not for cardiovascular patients Are optimal. The module to be developed in the module Medical Technology / Telemedicine Medical Shiny web application allows the attending physician, Manufacturer-independent retrospective training data of his patients in various Data formats, import, analyze, medically relevant indicators And graphically represent the results in different plots. The optimal Lower and upper heart rate limits is thereby individualized by the doctor for each patient And can be adapted during the course of the therapy. On the one hand, Patients receive immediate feedback on the training, on the other hand The physician's key medical data for training as well as therapy compliance. The Compilation of patients to homogeneous cardiosport groups is facilitated. About that The uniform, objective evaluation and simple documentation by exporting the data also to use in clinical trials to provide valid findings for assessing the importance of motion therapy compared to alternative treatment approaches in this and other patient groups (e.g., obesity) win.</p>
			
			<li>Functionality</li>
			
			<p>a. patient information</p>
			<p>Specify the name of the patient in the input panel. By clicking on the checkboxes, you optionally enter the date of birth, sex, body size and weight for the patient.</p><br>			
			
			<p>b. Training data</p>
			<p>Load a patient's training data (compatible with CSV, GPX files according to Polar-Foramt and TCX format) into the application via the button provided in the side input panel. If repeated data is loaded, a dialog box appears asking whether the loaded data is still part of the patient already specified. If no, the current patient data is deleted and you can specify new patient data.</p><br>
			
			<p>c. Adjust the target heart rate</p>
			<p>In the lateral input panel, the minimum and maximum permissible heart rate range is defined in a patient-specific manner. You then determine the patient's stress intensity. The optimal heart rate range is set for this patient. You can customize it at any time.</p><br>
			
			<p>d. Data table</p>
			<p>In the main screen, you can view the loaded training data in a table under the 'Data' tab.</p><br>
			
			<p>e. Graphical representation</p>
			<p>The graphical representation of the optimal heart rate range is made under the tab 'Graph'. For the display, the time or distance can be selected for the x axis, the heart rate, distance, speed, altitude above NN can be selected and visualized for the x axis.</p><br>
			
			<p>f. Map display</p>
			<p>The representation of the optimal heart rate range in relation to the distance traveled in the terrain is done under the tab 'Map'.</p><br>

			<p><i>g. Summary</i></p>
			<p>A summary and statistical representation can be found under the 'Summary' tab. You can generate an expression of the summary in PDF form.</p><br>
			
			<p>g. Settings</p>
			<p>Under the tab 'Settings', you can adjust the color representation of the optimal heart rate range, set the permissible maximum heart rate, select the map material, and select the display size for the graphical and textual display of the data.</p>
