			<li>Aim of the app</li>
			
			<p>Movement therapy is a key building block in treatment and rehabilitation Of patients with cardiovascular disease. Decisive is an individual to the Patient-matched therapy with medically prescribed heart rate limits to a To achieve the goal of therapy effectively without overstating the patient. The "Guideline Physical activity for the secondary prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases" distinguishes six categories of intensity from "very light" (level 1) to "maximum" (level 6).</p>
			
			<p>Real-time monitoring and documentation of heart rate during cardiosports With the introduction of various non-invasive measuring principles and systems for the Patients easy and cheap possible. The manufacturers of the sensors usually offer Visualizations for the gym, which are often not for cardiovascular patients Are optimal. The module to be developed in the module Medical Technology / Telemedicine Medical Shiny web application allows the attending physician, Manufacturer-independent retrospective training data of his patients in various Data formats, import, analyze, medically relevant indicators And graphically represent the results in different plots. The optimal Lower and upper heart rate limits is thereby individualized by the doctor for each patient And can be adapted during the course of the therapy. On the one hand, Patients receive immediate feedback on the training, on the other hand The physician's key medical data for training as well as therapy compliance. The Compilation of patients to homogeneous cardiosport groups is facilitated. About that The uniform, objective evaluation and simple documentation by exporting the data also to use in clinical trials to provide valid findings for assessing the importance of motion therapy compared to alternative treatment approaches in this and other patient groups (e.g., obesity) win.</p>
